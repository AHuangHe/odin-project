Flexbox
- A relatively new way to organize elements in a webpage
- It has become the default way of positioning elements
- Inspecting and debugging things using dev tools will be crucial
- Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns
- These items will flex (grow or shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define

Flex container and Flex items
- A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it
- A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container
- Any element can be both a flex container and a flex item
  - You can also put diplay: flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children
- Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way to build complex layouts

- The first step in using flexbox is to turn one of our HTML elements into a flex container
- We do this with the display property, giving it a value of flex
- Explicitly defining flex containers means that you can mix and match flexbox with other layout models
- After getting a flex container, the next job is to define the horizontal alignment of its items
  - We use the justify-content property for this
  - justify-content: center has the same effect as adding a margin: 0 auto declaration to the element to center (flex item)
  - flex-start and flex-end values would align the elements to the left and right respectively
  - space-around and space-between are useful with multiple flex items
  - space-around -> spreads items out across 
  - space-between -> like around but only adds space between items
- We can also group flex items (inside a div) to add more complexity
- For vertical alignment, we can use the property align-items: value
  - the values are smilar to justify-content:
    - center
    - flex-start (top)
    - flex-end (bottom)
    - stretch (fills the whole space vertically)
    - baseline

- To create a (flexbox) grid, we need the flex-wrap property
- It forces items that don't fit to get pumbed down to the next row

Flex containers properties
- We can transform flexbox rows into columns using only 1 line of code: flex-direction (column and row)
- Changing the alignment also rotates the direction of justify-content property (now becomes vertical alignment)
- To horizontally center our column, we need to define the align-items property
- The flex-direction property also lets you control the order of items (row-reverse and column-reverse)
- In a row-reverse, for example, the reversing only happens in a per row basis
  - So, if there are 2 rows after wrapping, the first row will be reversed independently of the second row
- The column-reverse value is particularly useful for mobile layouts
- Always separate content from presentation:
  - Changing the order like this is purely presentational, but your html should still make sense without these styles applied

Flex items properties
- It's also possible to manipulate individual items, not just their containers
- The order property in a flex item defines its order in the container without affecting surrouding items
- The default value is 0, increasing and decreasing the value moves the item right or left, respectively
- The order property works accross row/column boundaries
- For the example, setting the order of the first item to 1 and the last item to -1, the order becomes: -1, 0, 0, 0, 1
- We can do the same thing with vertical alignment using the align-self property
- Changing this property overrides the align-items value from its container

Flexible items
- Flex items are flexible, they can shrink and stretch to match the width of their containers
- The flex property also works as a weight that tells the flex container how to distribute extra space to each item
- An item with a flex value of 2 will grow twice as fast as items with the default value of 1

Static item widths
- We can mix-and-match flexible boxes with fixed-width ones
- The flex:initial property falls back to the item's explicit width property
- For example, we can make 3 elements be fixed - flexible - fixed, making only the middle element stretch and shrink

Auto-Margins
- Can be used as an alternative to an extra <div> when trying to align a group of items to the left/right of a container
- Basically a "divider" for flex items in the same container 
- Auto-margins eat up all the extra space in a flex container, moves the item and any following items to the right side of the container
