The Box Model
- Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular Box
- These can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another
- Box Elements:
  - content: space where the content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height
  - padding: space between the border of a box and the content of a box
  - margin: space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes
  - border: space between the padding and the margin of a box
- Useful Properties:
  - background-color
  - color
  - height and width
  - border -> size type color
  - display -> inline-size and block-size or width and height
  * box-sizing: border-box -> makes it so that the height and width of the entire box 
                                    (2*padding + 2*border + actual box space) are equal to the defined height and width
- Types:
  - We can fit boxes into block boxes and inline boxes
  - The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes
  - Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type
  - You can set various values for the display type using the display property
  - Outer Display Type:
    - The box will break onto a new line
    - The width and height properties are respected
    - Padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
    - If width unspecified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container
    - If it has an outer display type of *inline*:
      - The box will not break onto a new line
      - The width and height properties will not apply
      - Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
      - Left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
    - <h1> and <p> use block as their outer display type by default
  - Inner Display Type:
    - Dictates how elements inside that box are laid out
    - Block + inline layout is the default way things behave on the web
    - By default, elements inside a box are also laid out in normal flow and behave as block or inline boxes
    - Setting display: flex;, the element will still use the outer display type block but this changes the inner display to flex
      - Any direct children of this box will become flex items and behave like a Flexbox
    - <a>, <span>, <em>, and <strong> use inline as their outer display type by default
  - The key thing to remember for now is: Changing the value of the display property can change whether the outer display type of a box is block or inline. 
    This changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout.
  - Example of how to use box-sizing (The alternative box model - common)
    html {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }
    - Setting box-sizing in html and set all other elements to inherit that value

- Using display: inline-block
  - Special value of display, which provides a middle ground between inline and block.
  - Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect width and height and avoid overlapping
    - Width and height properties are respected
    - Padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box
  - This can be useful when you want to give a link a larger hit area by adding padding.
  - By using inline-block, you can allow padding to be set to an element like <a> (an inline element like <span>)
  - This can be seen frequently in navigation bars
  - Example: you can use it to make sure the padding is respected by other elements

- Margins:
  - Margins are set using lengths, percentages, or the keyword auto and can have negative values.
  - Can accept 4 values (one for each side); if fewer than 4, then it will autocomplete the other ones
  - If only 1 value, all 4 margins will be the same value
  - In most cases, a value of auto will be 0 or else whatever space is available on any side
  - Auto is handy for horizontal centering (only)
  - Without a specified width, the auto values would essentially have no effect
  - Vertical margins will collapse (overlap), forming a single margin equal to the largest margin
  - Margin collapse also applies to nested elements
  - Negative margins pulls other elements toward the element

Block vs Inline:
- Most elements are block elements
- By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line
- Inline elements don't start on a new line, they appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside
- A clear example of an inline element <a>, it will behave like a part of a paragraph
- Padding and margin behave differently on inline elements (in general don't put extra padding or margin on them)

- Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin
- Useful to know, but in practice, using flexbox will be the way to go

Divs and Spans:
- They give no particular meaning to their content, they are just generic boxes that can contain anything
- We can give an id or class to target them for styling with CSS
- Another use case is grouping related elements under one parent element to correctly position them on the page
- Div is a block-level element by default. Commonly used as a container element to group other elements
- Span is an inline-level element by default. Can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements for styling
  - Should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate

Normal Flow:
- By default, a block-level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it
- The size of inline-level elements is just the size of their content
- The normal layout flow is the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport
- By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction
- Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified
- Inline elements don't appear on new lines (they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent/wrapped text content)
  as long as there is apace for them to do so inside the width of the parent block-level element
- If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line
