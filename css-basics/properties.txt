Most common properties to work with in CSS:

- Color and background-color
  - Color sets an element's text color, while background-color sets the background
  - These can accept color keywords (like red), as well as HEX, RGB, and HSL values
  p {
    /* hex example: */
    color: #1100ff;
    }

  p {
    /* rgb example: */
    color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
    }

  p {
    /* hsl example: */
    color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
    }

- Typography basics and text-align
  - font-family can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses
    - Each font will fall into one of two categories:
      - either a "font family name" like "Times New Roman"
      - or a "generic family name" like sans-serif (no need for quotations)
      - If a browser can't find/doesn't support the first font in a list, it will try to move down the list until it finds one
      - Preferrably go from "font family name" that you most want to a generic font family as a fallback
  - font-size will set the size of the font
    - When giving a value, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. font-size:22px
  - font-weight affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight
    - The value can be a keyword (like font-weight:bold) or a number between 1 and 1000 (like font-weight:700) (usually in increments of 100)
  - text-align will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use common keywords like center, left, right, etc.

- Image height and width
  - By default, the <img> element's height and width values will be the same as the file's dimensions.
  - To modify the size without changing the proportions, we can set the img's height to auto and only change the width
  - It is best to include these properties even if not planning to adjust them (will reserve a space in the page for the image)
  img {
    height: auto;
    width: 500px;
  }
