Growing and Shrinking
- The flex property is a shorthand for 3 properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
- A value of 1 equates to flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0
- When applying flex: 1 to every div, we are telling them to grow the same amount
- Flex-grow and flex-shrink work in a similar way: the higher the value, the larger the rate of growth/shrink
- Flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, any grow/shrink starts from this baseline
  - Setting it to auto tells the item to check for a width declaration
  - The default value is auto, but once you set a single value to flex, its value becomes 0
  - A value of flex: auto is interpreted as flex: 1 1 auto

Axes (flex-direction property)
- A flexbox can work horizontally (the default) or vertically
- When changing the div to columns, we have to be mindful
  - Empty divs by default have 0 height, so if we set flex to 1, we are setting flex-basis to 0, which tells the div to start the height at 0
  - All the 3 properties now affect the height and not the width
  - Changin the div to column adds complexity because block-level elements default to the height of their content, and if there is no content then the above issue could happen
