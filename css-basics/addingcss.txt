There are 3 ways to add CSS to HTML

- External CSS
  - The most common method, which involves creating a separate file for the CSS 
    and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closing <head> tags with a self-closing <link> element
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  - The href attribute is the location of the CSS file (absolute or relative)
  - The rel attribute is required, and 
    it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file
  - Pros:
    - Keeps HTML and CSS separated, making them look cleaner
    - We only need to edit the CSS in one place

- Internal (Embedded) CSS
  - Involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself
  - You place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags,
    which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of the HTML file.
  - This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website,
    but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method

- Inline CSS
  - Makes it possible to add styles directly to HTML elements, though not as recommended
  - No need to use any selectors (we use the style= attribute inside a tag)
  - Can work fine if you need to add a unique style for a single element
  - Cons:
    - The file can quickly become messy and bloated
    - For many elements to have the same style, 
      you would have to copy and paste the same style to each element
    - It can override either of the 2 previous methods
