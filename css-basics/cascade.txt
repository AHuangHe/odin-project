The cascade of CSS
  - The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML
  - There are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this, 3 of which are:
    - Specificity
      - A more specific CSS declaration will take precedence over less specific ones
      - Inline styles have the highest specificity
      - Otherwise:
        - ID selectors (most specific selector)
        - Class selectors
        - Type selectors
      - Serves as a tie-breaker when an item has multiple conflicting declarations
      - A larger amount of selectors will beat a single selector (i.e. 2 class selectors vs only 1)
      - The universal selector (*) and combinators (+, ~, >, empty space) don't add any specificity

    - Inheritance
      - CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element's descendants
      - Typography based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren't
      - Directly targeting an element always beats inheritance

    - Rule Order
      - What happens when every other factor has been taken into account and there are still multiple conflicting rules?
      - The end of the line: Whichever rule was the last defined is the winner
