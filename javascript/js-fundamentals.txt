Fundamentals I
- We can include JavaScript code in an html file inside the <script></script> section
- console.log() is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser
- Another way to include JavaScript in a webpage is through an external script
  - <script src="javascript.js"></script>

- Variables
  - We can declare variables in three var, let, and const
  - Used to be only var, but now let and const are better ways to declare variables
  - We can declare multiple variables in one line, but for the sake of readability, do it line by line
  - We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other
  - Declaring a variable twice triggers an error
  - Variable naming limitations:
    - name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
    - the first character must not be a digit
    - camelCase is commonly used
    - case matters
  - Constants
    - We can declare unchanging variables with const
    - Uppercase Constants
      - Use all capital letters and underscores for difficult-to-remember values
      - capital-named constants are only used as aliases for "hard-coded" values
    - For constants evaluated in run-time, use the regular naming system
  - Use human-readable names for variables
  - Make names maximally descriptive and concise
